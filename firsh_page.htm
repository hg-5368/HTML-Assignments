    <h1>BGMI banned in India</h1>
    <p>The recent ban on the popular strike game Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) run by Krafton Inc, has one again brought the limelight on the urgent need to create regulation for the online gaming industry. “There is regulatory uncertainty in the gaming ecosystem. A comprehensive set of guidelines and regulations need to be established that will ensure that the industry is clear about the expectations of the government and can meet them. Regulation will ensure that there is some sort of escalation mechanism, grievance redressal mechanism available not just to players but also to game operators,” Sameer Barde, CEO, EGF, told BrandWagon Online.</p>
