    <h1>The monkeypox outbreak, first spotted in Europe in late April, has now reached 75 countries</h1>
    <h2>The U.S. now has had the most people infected, with more than 3,500 of the world's 17,000 diagnoses.</h2>
    <h3>Spain, with the next-highest case load of more than 3,100, has one-seventh of our population. </h3>
    <h4> New York City, with more than 1,000 cases, sits at the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.</h4>
    <h5>World Health Organization declared monkeypox a "public health emergency of international concern," joining COVID-19 and polio in that designation.</h5>
    <h6>As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), places like central Africa having insufficient healthcare facilities, 1 in 10 infected people die if they are prone to the virus.</h6>
    <p>The latency period of the monkeypox virus is 21 days after which the symptoms start arising. The symptoms of monkeypox are lighter as compared to the smallpox symptoms. Fever, headache, muscle pain, exhaustion and swollen lymph nodes are some of the symptoms of the monkeypox virus. Followed by these symptoms, people start having rashes on their skin which often begin to appear on their face and then spread to the other body parts. The rashes keep spreading until they form a scab and shed off. This disease lasts for a period of two to four weeks source

        <p><em>This disease can pass on to humans if they get bitten by a monkeypox infected animal or come in contact with the infected animal’s blood, body fluids or fur. Consuming the meat of the diseased animal without properly cooking it might also lead to the spread of this infection.</em> <strong>The Congo strain and the West African strain are the two variants of monkeypox. The Congo strain is more fatal than the West African strain. While the Congo strain has the mortality rate of 10%, the West African strain has a lower mortality rate of 1%.</strong></p>
